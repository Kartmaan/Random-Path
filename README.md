# random_plot_turtle

## Functioning
Draws a random graph within spatial boundaries. The turtle moves from left to right and randomly changes its angular orientation with each iteration. Ascending segments are colored green and descending segments are colored red. The function has 5 parameters:
- `strip` : defines the width of the strip in which the graph will be drawn
- `step` : length of the step between each change of direction of the turtle
- `angle_range` : angular freedom of movement of the turtle
- `info` : display on the surface information related to function parameters
- `show_strip` : display the upper and lower limits between which the graph is drawn
